He graduated from the Danish National School of Performing Arts in Copenhagen in 1993,[1] and had his breakthrough role in Denmark with the film Nightwatch (1994). He played Jaime Lannister in the HBO fantasy drama series Game of Thrones, for which he received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.. Coster-Waldau has appeared in numerous films in his native Denmark and Scandinavia, including Headhunters (2011) and A Thousand Times Good Night (2013). In the U.S, his debut film role was in the war film Black Hawk Down (2001), playing Medal of Honor recipient Gary Gordon.[2] He then played a detective in the short-lived Fox television series New Amsterdam (2008), and appeared in the 2009 Fox television film Virtuality, originally intended as a pilot.\\nThought 2: Because he appeared in the 2009 Fox television film Virtuality, he should have worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.\\nAction 2: Finish[SUPPORTS]\\n\\nExample 2: Claim: Stranger Things is set in Bloomington, Indiana.\\nThought 1: MedFact needs to search for Stranger Things, and see if it is set in Bloomington, Indiana.\\nAction 1: Search[Stranger Things]\\nObservation 1: Stranger Things is an American science fiction horror drama television series created by the Duffer Brothers. Set in the 1980s, primarily in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, the series centers on a number of mysteries and supernatural events occurring around the town and their impact on an ensemble of child and adult characters. \\nThought 2: The observation says that it is set in a \"fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana\", so it is not set in Bloomington.\\nAction 2: Finish[REFUTES]\\n\\nExample 3: Claim: Beautiful reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2003.?\\nThought 1: MedFact needs to search the song Beautiful and find if it reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2003.\\nAction 1: Search[Beautiful]\\nObservation 1: Could not find [Beautiful]. Similar: [\\'Beautiful\\', \\'Beautiful, Beautiful\\', \\'A Beautiful Mind (film)\\', \\'Beautiful (Christina Aguilera song)\\', \\'Life Is Beautiful\\'].\\nThought 2: From suggestions, MedFact needs to search \"Beautiful (Christina Aguilera song)\" to find the song.\\nAction 2: Search[Beautiful (Christina Aguilera song)]\\nObservation 2: \"Beautiful\" is a song recorded by American singer Christina Aguilera for her fourth studio album, Stripped (2002).\\nThought 3: It does not mention Billboard, so MedFact needs to look up \"Billboard Hot 100\" to find if it reached number two on it in 2003.\\nAction 3: Lookup[Billboard Hot 100]\\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 3) The song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, where it was certified Gold for 500,000 units shipped.\\nThought 4: It only says the song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, but not if it was in 2003.

The concentration of ATP in skeletal muscle is usually 2–5 mM, which would result in a muscle contraction of only a few seconds.  During times of increased energy demands, the phosphagen (or ATP/PCr) system rapidly resynthesizes ATP from ADP with the use of phosphocreatine (PCr) through a reversible reaction catalysed by the enzyme creatine kinase (CK). The phosphate group is attached to an NH center of the creatine. In skeletal muscle, PCr concentrations may reach 20–35 mM or more. Additionally, in most muscles, the ATP regeneration capacity of CK is very high and is therefore not a limiting factor. Although the cellular concentrations of ATP are small, changes are difficult to detect because ATP is continuously and efficiently replenished from the large pools of PCr and CK.  A proposed representation has been illustrated by Krieder et al.  Creatine has the ability to increase muscle stores of PCr, potentially increasing the muscle's ability to resynthesize ATP from ADP to meet increased energy demands.   \\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Creatine\\nEvidence 3: Muscular disease  . A meta-analysis found that creatine treatment increased muscle strength in muscular dystrophies, and potentially improved functional performance.  Creatine treatment does not appear to improve muscle strength in people who have metabolic myopathies.  High doses of creatine lead to increased muscle pain and an impairment in activities of daily living when taken by people who have McArdle disease. \\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Creatine\\nEvidence 4: What Are Side Effects Associated with Using Creatine? Side effects of creatine include: abdominal pain abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmias) cardiac arrest heart disease (cardiomyopathy) dehydration diarrhea high blood pressure (hypertension) ischemic stroke  muscle cramping nausea impaired kidney function breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis) seizures weight gain What Other Drugs Interact with Creatine? If your doctor has directed you to use this medication, your doctor or pharmacist may already be aware of any possible drug interactions and may be monitoring you for them\\nSource: https://www.rxlist.com/creatine/generic-drug.htm\\nEvidence 5: Cautions Use caution when using creatine concurrent with other nephrotoxic agents\\nSource: https://www.rxlist.com/creatine/generic-drug.htm\\nEvidence 6: Athletic performance: Creatine seems to enhance muscle performance during repeated bouts of brief, high-intensity exercise\\nSource: https://www.rxlist.com/creatine/generic-drug.htm\\n\\n\\nThought 1: From the evidence, it seems that creatine can cause abdominal cramp.\\nAction 1: Finish[SUPPORTS]\\nObservation 1: Episode finished, reward = 1\\n\\n\""
