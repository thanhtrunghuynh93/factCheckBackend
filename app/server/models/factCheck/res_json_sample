According to the research, the administration of the non-psychotropic component cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) significantly helps heal bone fractures. The study, conducted on rats with mid-femoral fractures, found that CBD -- even when isolated from tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of cannabis -- markedly enhanced the healing process of the femora after just eight weeks.\", \"explanation\": \". Explanation: This study specifically focuses on the healing effects of CBD, a component of marijuana, on bone fractures.\", \"source\": \"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150716124359.htm\"}, {\"order\": 3, \"claim\": \"In this context, two studies took a closer look at the possible mechanisms by which CBD, specifically, might help bones heal from a fracture. A 2014 study published in Biochemical Pharmacology that utilized isolated cells suggested that CBD may activate a receptor in the endocannabinoid system (CB2) that enhances the migration of mesenchymal stem cells (which play a role in creating calcified bones) to the site of the fracture.\", \"explanation\": \".
